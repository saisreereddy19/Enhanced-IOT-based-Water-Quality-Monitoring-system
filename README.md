This IoT-based Water Quality Monitoring System uses sensors like DS18B20 for water temperature, TDS sensor for measuring water salinity, and a turbidity sensor to check water clarity. These sensors are connected to a microcontroller ESP8266 for data collection and transmission. The system monitors water quality in real-time, making it suitable for various applications like households or industries.
